> At OMA SpecWorks, there is a membership level right for all companies.

As a member of OMA SpecWorks, your company will have the opportunity to participate directly in our standards-building process, which is driven by our diverse member community and supported by an experienced staff. You will have access, via our web-based members’ portal, to the most up-to-date information on OMA’s service enablers. In addition, you will join the world’s leading mobile operators, device manufacturers, infrastructure and IT vendors, and application developers in face-to-face conversations where the next generation of specifications for wireless services are debated and defined.  

## Unveiling OMA's Membership Since 2002

Since the inception of the OMA in 2002, the benefits of membership have largely remained consistent. The distinctions between membership levels have primarily been defined by voting rights, structured as follows:

- **Sponsor Members** hold a seat on the Board of Directors, possess the right to sponsor new work items, and have the ability to vote on technical matters in the Plenary and Working Groups.

- **Full Members** enjoy the same rights as Sponsor Members but do not automatically hold a Board seat. However, they may stand for election to the Board.

- **Associate Members** have contribution rights and voting privileges within the Working Groups.

- **Supporter Members** have contribution rights within the Working Groups but do not possess voting rights.

With a focus on consensus-driven standards, OMA's membership benefits have been designed to support active collaboration across industries. As we transition to a more industry-facing structure aligned with Industrial IoT, we’re excited to introduce a streamlined membership framework in 2025, making it easier to access and leverage [OMA benefits](/omaspecworks/membership/benefits#membership-benefits).
