## OMNA Registries
> **OMNA Registries**: The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) plays a crucial role in ensuring the interoperability and compatibility of OMA technologies by managing essential names and numbers across various registries, including the Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) Registry. OMNA simplifies the process for users by providing clear guidelines and a streamlined approach to navigate these registries. This includes submitting requests for assigned names, IDs, numbers, or objects, which are then reviewed and recorded in OMNA’s database, ensuring consistent use across OMA implementations. Through these registries, OMNA supports seamless integration within the OMA ecosystem, fostering a reliable and cohesive environment for technology deployment.

### How the OMNA Process Works

The OMNA process, currently based on the WINA process established by WAP, guides the allocation of names and numbers. Until an OMA-specific version is developed, use the WAP WINA process document as a reference.

### Submitting Requests for Assigned Names or Numbers

To request an OMNA assigned name or number:

1. **Fill Out the OMNA Request Form**: Select the appropriate Name Space.
2. **Review Process**: Your request will be reviewed by the OMNA Secretary and the Release Planning and Management Committee.
3. **Assignment and Recording**: Once approved, the name or number will be recorded in the OMNA database.

You can find the request form on the relevant pages listed below.

### OMNA Administration

OMNA is administered by the OMNA Secretary. If you have any comments or questions about OMNA or its processes, please contact the OMNA Secretary through the OMA Contacts page.

### OMNA Name and Number Database

OMNA maintains several name and number registries. These registries help ensure consistent use of names and numbers across implementations.
