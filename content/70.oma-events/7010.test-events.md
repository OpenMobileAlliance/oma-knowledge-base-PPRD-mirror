## Event Overview

#### Two Connected Parts, One OMA Event

> Choose the part that fits your goals—or attend both for maximum impact.

- **Test Event**: Technical engineers, implementers, and product teams validate interoperability and conformance in a structured Specification Validation Event (SVE).
- **OMA WG Meetings**: OMA members collaborate on work items, roadmaps, and technical discussions related to LwM2M and other specifications.
- **Both parts** run in the same overall timeframe and location (onsite/virtual details as applicable), making it easy for teams to split roles across activities.

## Part 1 - OMA LwM2M Test Event (SVE-44)

#### Hands-on interoperability and conformance testing for your LwM2M and Smart City solutions.

### Who Should Attend
- LwM2M client and server implementers, device makers, and solution providers.
- QA, interoperability, and standards engineers responsible for product readiness.

### What You Will Do
- Test your implementations in multi-vendor combinations in a confidential environment.
- Identify interoperability issues early and get direct feedback from peers and OMA experts.
- Validate against the latest LwM2M releases and Smart City data models as applicable.

### Key Benefits
- Improve time-to-market by resolving interoperability issues before deployment.
- Gain visibility into the maturity of your implementation versus the ecosystem.
- Contribute findings that help refine OMA specifications and best practices.

### Practical Details
- Dates: **20–23 April 2026**.
- Location / Format: **Kraków (Poland) / Onsite & Virtual**.
- Participation: **Open to OMA members and non-members (subject to event terms)**.

### What You Will Do
- Join plenary sessions and Working Group breakouts on ongoing and future work items.
- Review updates from recent test events and workshops and feed them into standards evolution.
- Network with other member organizations and explore collaboration opportunities.

### Key Benefits
- Influence the direction of OMA specifications and profiles your organization depends on.
- Stay ahead of upcoming releases, reference implementations, and industry adoption trends.
- Align your roadmap with the wider ecosystem.

        </br>
        **Test Events** or **SVEs** are held in a confidential and secure testing environment where
        companies can bring their Client or Server implementation(s) based on an OMA
        Enabler to test in multiple multi-vendor combinations. These events are open to
        both OMA member and non-member companies.
