  The Device Management & Smart Objects Working Group (DMSO WG) designed and
  maintains the Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) protocol that is used to manage mobile
  devices, service access and software on connected devices across Internet of
  Things (IoT) networks.

  Since 2002, the DMSE WG has released a suite of specifications which includes
  20+ mobile service enabler specifications and more than 60 Management Objects
  providing simple, reliable and cost-effective ways to deploy new applications
  and services while minimizing the risk. The most market diffused of the
  Management Objects is certainly the Firmware Update Management Object (FUMO)
  with **deployments in the billions of devices**. An additional 20+ Management
  Objects have been defined by other standards organizations, which cooperate
  with OMA SpecWorks to avoid fragmentation and duplication. DMSE technologies
  easily manage converged and multi-mode devices on any network, including
  devices that do not have a SIM card, as well as resource-constrained devices.

         IPSO
text: |
  In December 2017, the IPSO Alliance joined forces with the Open Mobile Alliance.
  OMA SpecWorks was launched in early 2018 from the two organizations and the IPSO
  Smart Objects Working Group (IPSO WG) was formed. The IPSO WG is focused on
  enabling IoT devices to communicate, understand and trust each other with global
  interoperability based on open standards.

  IPSO WG’s charter is to develop, establish, and create the industry leadership
  of an “IPSO Platform” that includes the definition and support of Smart Objects
  with an emphasis on object interoperability on protocol and data layers and of
  Identity and Privacy technologies. The mission is to create a platform and
  support system that includes libraries, repositories, design kits, and industry
  awareness for discovery and interoperability of IoT Smart Objects.

  The IPSO Alliance is not a standards organization, but an alliance that
  promotes and supports Smart Objects, and manages an IPSO Smart Object Registry
  that includes libraries, icons and repositories to be used by worldwide standard
  definition organizations (SDOs), special interest groups (SIGs), open
  communities and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The creation of a fully
  functional IPSO Smart Object Registry provides an avenue for industry adoption.
  IPSO has the goal to create Smart Object definitions, instantiations, data
  models, design models, reference architectures, icons, and brand, which include
  all the attributes needed to be an integral component of an IoT Smart Object Marketplace.
