This tool allows developers to manually interact with an LWM2M Server directly from their browser, providing an interactive environment to explore and understand machine-to-machine communication protocols. Key features of the DevKit include support for OMA Lightweight M2M 1.0, virtual LWM2M clients, and editing capabilities for object instances and resources. The tool also offers comprehensive interfaces for client registration, device management, service enablement, and information reporting, complete with logging and visualization of LWM2M operations and their CoAP messages. Available as both a release version on the Mozilla Add-ons site and a developer version via GitHub, the OMA LWM2M DevKit is an essential resource for developers aiming to leverage the latest advancements in machine-to-machine communication
