A gateway may translate addresses, protocols, or commands along the IoT service path. As various types of gateways proliferate in IoT services, the communication security between sender and receiver depends on the security of each hop combined with business agreements and trust relations between the involved parties. Hop-by-hop security offers more points of attack and is a greater risk to the IoT service as IoT proxies such as application-layer gateways and middleboxes may alter the messages they forward at various protocol layers in the stack. The theme of this paper is that IoT data must be secure in transit and securing data at the transport layer alone is not always sufficient for preserving integrity and confidentiality through proxies, gateways or other middleboxes. Application-layer security is needed for many IoT service topologies to prevent critical data from becoming unprotected in middleboxes. The paper gives real-world use cases for application-layer end-to-end IoT security and describes the Open Mobile Alliance solution to these types of use cases."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You can download the PDF "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.openmobilealliance.org/documents/whitepapers/OMA-WP-e2e_Sec_IoT-20191024-A.pdf","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"here"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://omaspecworks.org/contact-us/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Contact us"}]},{"type":"text","value":" for more information."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Let's keep in touch, "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://account.openmobilealliance.org/AccountCreation/GetAccount.asp","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"sign up here"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:5.news:articles:2019-07-30-E2E-security-for-IoT.md","_source":"content","_file":"5.news/articles/2019-07-30-E2E-security-for-IoT.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/news/articles/2020-12-09-lwm2m-release","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"LwM2M v1.2 is now available!","description":"The standardization work on the LwM2M v1.2 specification has been completed and the specification bundle is now available for public download.Originally proposed in 2012, LwM2M v1.0 was finally published in early 2017 after comprehensive research with developers across multiple industries and application areas.
